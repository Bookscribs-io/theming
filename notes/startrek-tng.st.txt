:: Description
Star Trek: The Next Generation (abbreviated as TNG and ST:TNG) is an American science-fiction television series in the Star Trek franchise created by Gene Roddenberry that ran from 1987 to 1994. Roddenberry, Maurice Hurley, Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor served as executive producers at different times throughout its production. The show was very popular, reaching almost 12 million viewers in its 5th season, with the series finale in 1994 being watched by over 30 million viewers. The show spawned two reasonably popular spin-offs set in the same sci-fi universe time and place, and four movies with the cast of the show. In the early 2000s the show Enterprise, although more oriented towards re-booting the series, was in the same fictional universe, but set during an earlier time.

The series involves a starship named Enterprise and is set in the nearby regions of the Milky Way galaxy, the Alpha Quadrant. The first episode takes place in the year 2364, 99 years after the start of the five-year mission described in the original series, which began in 2265.
