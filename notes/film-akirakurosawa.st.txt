:: Choice Themes
the horrors of war [we saw the farmer's lot in medeival japan as bands of desperate banits raided their villages for food; we saw people fearful of being killed; we saw people dying pitifully],
cooperation [we saw that when people cooperated they became strong and when they did not, disaster followed],

:: Major Themes
alternate points of view [we were constantly reminded of how samurai and peasats saw the world differently; to some extent also the ronin],
a danger shared can bring people together [the ronin threat forced the farmers to cooperate and seems to have brought them closer to each other],
