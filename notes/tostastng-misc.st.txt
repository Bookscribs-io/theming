1) A hilarious misunderstanding of dark matter is illustrated by Riker when he says "Let's light up this nebula." 2) Data misses an opportunity to use the Maltuvis device in the teaser when he talks about the romantic failings of King Henry VIII. 3) The realization just dawned on me that the model for Data is an autistic person. 1) Humans have "programs" running in their brains, too. 
2) Why is she perpetually acting like Data should have emotions when she knows very well he does not? Does star fleet's “highest standards of quality” allow for complete morons on the flagship?
