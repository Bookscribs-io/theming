three centuries of time found themselves telepathically linked, and fell in
love. Alas, as they would never be able to meet in person, the young girl from 
the 17th century took the tough decision to terminate their disagreeably 
platonic relationship.

In tz1985e3x09 "The Call", Norman fell in love with a mysterious woman 
he spoke to only on the phone. The sentiment was reciprocated. Unfortunately, he
came to find that the woman was the spirit of a successfully suicidal

into a statue of his own, dotingly contraposed with the other for eternity.

teen romance
============

Young characters engage in romantic relationships, perhaps for their first
time, and the relationship is notably featured in the story.

:: Notes
There are stories in which "boyfriend and girlfriend" applies because two
characters are described as such, but where nevertheless there was no
notable idea of romance (explicitly or by its conspicuous absence). This
typically happens when the relationship is entirely irrelevant to the story.
In such cases we do not use "teen romance".

:: Parents
young lovers


what if a child had power over adults
=====================================

:: Description
We are made to imagine a situation in which a child exercises notable
authority over an adult. This can, for example, happen because the child has 
supernatural powers that enable them to enforce their will.

:: Examples
In tz2019e1x05 "The Wunderkind", young sociopath Oliver Foley cleverly
manipulates public opinion and becomes elected president of the USA. Once
installed in the White House, it does not take long for Oliver's despotic
tendencies to bloom. Adults around him must jump to his childish whims for fear
of loosing their jobs or be accused of treason.

:: Description
We are made to ponder whether and to what extent the extrajudicial killing of 
patently wicked people can be morally sanctionable.

the human capacity for good and evil
====================================

:: Description
The story makes a point about individual human's capability to be both,
or alternatingly, good and evil.
If explicit reference is not made to this idea, a story is still deemed to
exhibit the theme if there is a character who in an exaggerated way is
both good and evil.

:: Examples
In, for example, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" (1931), Henry Jekyll 
used a drug to switch between dominant aspects of his own personality:

individuals. They ensure one's ability to participate in the civil and
political life of the society and state without discrimination or repression.
Such rights issues are discussed explicitly, or very pointedly illustrated.

:: Notes
This theme does not apply to isolated occurrences of racism, but should be
used when a systematic oppression of a category of people is clearly featured.

:: Examples

prevented from participating in the normal civil and political life of 
New New York because people saw them as sub-human scum that must stay hidden

post-truth politics
===================

:: Description
Clearly featured is a political culture in which debate is framed largely by appeals to emotion 
disconnected from the details of policy, and by the repeated assertion of talking points 
to which factual rebuttals are ignored. Post-truth differs from traditional contesting and 
falsifying of facts by relegating facts and expert opinions to be of secondary importance 
relative to appeal to emotion.

:: Examples
tz2019e1x05 "The Wunderkind" featured a presidency in which the leader, drunk on his own
power, invented ill-considered policies and forced them around him to agree to whatever
fake facts were expedient. A clear reference to Donald Trump's America.

=======================

:: Description
A character notices their own emotional inclination to do (or not to do) 
something, and that obeying them is undesirable. 
The character makes a reasonable attempt not to do so.

:: Notes
There are two contraposed formulas for when the theme applies: 
wanting to do vs. wanting to not do. 
For example, a character may feel like taking a smoke, but stops themself 
from doing so because they know it is ultimately bad for them.
Conversely, a character may be reluctant to stick their neck out and 
challenge a misbehaving superior they are afraid of, yet tries to
do so because they know it is the right thing to do.

romantic jealousy
=================

:: Description
A character is notably desirous of the exclusive affections that another 
receives from a potential lover.

In cases of infidelity, for example, it must be clear that resentment is over

their partner may still be upset about infidelity for the social stigma,
or for practical reasons. They are not, then, romantically jealous.
