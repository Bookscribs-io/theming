individual human experience
===========================

:: Description
This is the category of themes that center around an individual's personal thoughts, emotions, 
urges, ambitions, and other such experiences. 

:: Note
We distinguish between "individual human experience", "humans in pairs", and "humans in groups" with 
reference to whose experiences are relevant to the thematic idea that is being expressed. For example
"coping with problematic people" clearly implies the presence of two or more people but the theme
is only concerned with the experiences of a single observer at a time. "romantic relationship",
on the other hand, is a category of themes that most often examine the interaction between two 
people and discuss both their experiences simultanously. Likewise "humans in group" imply themes that
examine the constitution of a whole group of people, for example the idea that "lack of trust can lead 
to group dysfunction."

humans in group
===============

:: Description
This is the category of themes that examine human group dynamics, or some experience simultanously applicable to each member of a group of people.

:: Example
"insubordination" is considered a "humans in group" theme because even though it implies the actions of only a single person the ideas featured are typically related to how hierarchies of humans function when insubordination is either tolerated or prescribed to some extent.

:: Note
We distinguish between "individual human experience", "humans in pairs", and "humans in groups" with 
reference to whose experiences are relevant to the thematic idea that is being expressed. For example
"coping with problematic people" clearly implies the presence of two or more people but the theme

other people ought to lead their lives as well. This category may overlap with that of
political ideologies.

=================

:: Description
This is the category of themes that relate to human's need to feel safe from danger of all

(at least historically) lead to poverty, then starvation and death. "the need for privacy" is
also a "human safety need" because a lack of privacy could lead to the publication of facts
about us that jeopardize our social standing which might (historically) lead to ostracization,
then death in any number of ways.

This is the category of social issue themes that relate to the mental and physiological 
well-being of humans in a community.

:: Example

members of society may be concerned about loosing their jobs when a new technology emerges.
Similarly, "playing God with nature" discusses whether and to what extent we should let 
ourselves interfere with nature, for example by the use of gene modification, breeding 
programs, forestry, or any other interference with the biosphere.

human physiological need
========================

:: Description
This is the category of themes that relate to a person's physiological needs. I.e., the need for
things like food, water, sleep, and (in some sense) sex.

:: Example

sufficiently overworked and tired becomes incapable of considering higher order needs such
as staying out of harm's way.

socioeconomic issue
===================

:: Description
This is the category of social issue themes that relate to how society behaves vis-a-vis 
economic activity, i.e. broadly, the use of labor, capital, and land, for the production of goods

fit and function within society, and the creation of markets. Additionally, this category involves
themes that relate to how capital (wealth and money) is distributed.

:: Example

activity and the distribution of wealth.

somewhat closely related characters, i.e., "family". 

:: Note
Any defined character relationship can be familial if it is clearly considered as such in a 
story and if it is sufficiently relevant to the plot. It may be noted that while there are many
stories in which parental, sibling, half-sibling, step-parent, sibling-in-law, or even
adoptive relationships are important, there are few stories in which consanguinity relations
beyond first cousinage is relevant to the plot.

:: Example
"guardian and child" is a "human familial relationship" because the guardian is typically
expected to take on the role of a parent even if they are not related to the child by blood.

human rights issue
==================

:: Description
This is the category of themes that discusses issues that relate to whatever people typically like
to label as human rights. It may, for example, involve practical concerns around safeguarding such 
rights, discuss ethical questions around what counts as a right, or weight two conflicting human 
rights considerations in a particular situation.

Examples of rights and freedoms which are often thought of as human rights include civil and 
political rights, such as the right to life, liberty, and property, freedom of expression, 
pursuit of happiness and equality before the law; and social, cultural and economic rights,
including the right to participate in science and culture, the right to work, and the right to 
education. 

:: Example
"homosexuality in society" is a "human rights issue" because an overwhelming number of 
people now believe that systematically discriminated against someone on account of their sexuality 
would be an infringement on that person's rights.

Typically "human addiction" is connected to substance abuse, such as the case with "alcoholism" 
and "drug addiction". Other forms of addiction include "video game addiction", or "workaholism",  
although these examples may not be addictions in the clinical sense.

contraposed political ideologies
================================

:: Description
This is the category of themes that contrast two or more reasonably well-defined political 
ideologies.

:: Notes
The goal of this project is in no way to provoke political controversy. When 
using a word that references a political stance it is advisable to consult, for example, Wikipedia 
and use the word only in ways that appear mainstream and are relatively uncontroversial.

:: Examples
"conservative vs. liberal" is a theme of this kind that is often featured in contemporary stories.
We have a reasonably clear understanding of what conservative and liberal values are respectively, 
in a broad sense, even though we may disagree about many of the details.

psychological stress
====================

:: Description
A character experiences an unhealthy amount of mental strain and pressure due to some situation 
they are in. 

:: Notes
We generally do not use this theme in violent, action filled, scenarios where we assume that 
adrenaline and stress would be a relatively natural (and arguably healthy) response to a 
life-and-death situation.

:: Examples
"coping with the rigors of command" is a "psychological stress" theme as it implies that a 
character experiences unusual amounts of mental strain due to having a burden of responsibility.

This is the category of themes that center around one or another of the many organizing principles 
for a system of state government that have been proposed, and expressed in a way that makes it 
reasonably well-defined.

:: Notes
The goal of this project is in no way to provoke political controversy. When 
using a word that references a political stance it is advisable to consult, for example, Wikipedia 
and use the word only in ways that appear mainstream and are relatively uncontroversial.

:: Example
"anarchy", "democracy", "despotism", "federalism", "military dictatorship", and "totalitarianism"
are examples of "form of government" themes that are sometimes featured explicitly and the 
definition of which seem, for the most part, unproblematic when a few dictionaries are consulted.

environmental issue
===================

:: Description
This is the category of social issue themes that examine the effects human activity may have at 
large on the biophysical environment, i.e., on nature.

:: Examples
"climate change and bureaucratic inaction" may arguably be the most important "environmental issue"
theme of our times. The issue is that human activity since the industrial revolution has produced 
evermore greenhouse gases; this leads to an unrelenting heating of the whole of the Earth, which in 
turn has varied but significant effects on the climate. As these changes are expected to be widely
detrimental to human well being, many believe that the response from policy makers has been 
lackluster and negligent in the extreme.
