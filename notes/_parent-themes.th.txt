individual human experience
===========================

:: Description
This is the category of themes that center around an individual's personal thoughts, emotions, 
urges, ambitions, and other such experiences. 

:: Note
We distinguish between "individual human experience", "humans in pairs", and "humans in groups" with 
reference to whose experiences are relevant to the thematic idea that is being expressed. For example
"coping with problematic people" clearly implies the presence of two or more people but the theme
is only concerned with the experiences of a single observer at a time. "romantic relationship",
on the other hand, is a category of themes that most often examine the interaction between two 
people and discuss both their experiences simultanously. Likewise "humans in group" imply themes that
examine the constitution of a whole group of people, for example the idea that "lack of trust can lead 
to group dysfunction."

This is the category of themes that examine human group dynamics, or some experience simultanously applicable to each member of a group of people.

:: Example
"insubordination" is considered a "humans in group" theme because even though it implies the actions of only a single person the ideas featured are typically related to how hierarchies of humans function when insubordination is either tolerated or prescribed to some extent.

reference to whose experiences are relevant to the thematic idea that is being expressed. For example
