That is until one special woman gave birth to everyone's astonishment. It was later determined that she had a mutation that enabled her to reproduce asexually. As if this in itself is not enough to justify this theme, let it be known that Ellador was told the story of the Mary's miraculous virgin birth by Van.],

primary justification for the laws or the construct of the society. The
individual's behaviour is based on logic by way of formulas and equations
outlined by the One State.

:: Choice Themes
moon slowly spiraling into a planet [the remnants of Earth's old moon started falling down on the planet and rendering it uninhabitable],

:: Major Themes
speculative genetic engineering [The seven remaining women genetically engineered their respective offspring to create seven distinguishable different human races.],
genetically engineered person [The seven remaining women genetically engineered their respective offspring to create seven distinguishable  different human races.],
playing God with nature [the ethics of genetically engineering society was discussed and the consequences explored in part 3 of the story],
what if I found myself in a zero gravity environment [many aspects of what it is like to live without essential gravity were explained throughout],
hominid evolution [The line between the consequences of genetic engineering and natural selection are blurry, but the Neanderthals and so forth are discussed throughout part 3.],
future point of view [people 5000 years from now are digging up trucks and reflecting on life in the 3rd millenium],
international politics [in part 1 nations tried to get along while knowing they would all die; in part III seven new races of humans tried to get along but occasionally engaged in armed conflict],
the scientist profession [The story follows a variety of scientists, mostly physicists and biologists, as they try to device ways to survive while the rest of humanity perishes.],

revolution in society [part 2 featured a scrupulous politician fomenting unrest and breaking off with a faction of her own],
speculative terraforming [Earth, ironically, had to be terraformed to make it habitable again.],
smart ammunition [the spacers developed smart ammunition that would reconfigure itself so as not to puncture walls in space habitats],
astronomy [The story explains much about stellar bodies and orbital mechanics as the moon shattered into pieces.],
biology [The story explains how genes, chromosomes, and automictic parthogenesis works, etc.],
