gambling a bit longer.


you can't eat money

:: Description
It is explained or pointedly illustrated that things like money, 
or gold, has very little intrinsic value for a person when they lack
more basic necessities of life, such as food.

:: Parents
human idea about life

:: Examples
In tz1959e2x24 "The Rip Van Winkle Caper", we saw four crooks meticulously
carry out an elaborate heist for gold. They then fought and killed each 
other over the loot. Then one of them was forced to trade away gold bar

wishing or wanting something really hard makes it happen
========================================================

:: Description
The idea is featured that if someone (implied anyone) really wants, wishes,
needs, desires (etc. etc.) something then occasionally reality can
magically make that thing come true.

:: Notes
This is not a reliable "ability", but something that happens more or less
as a one-off to characters in special circumstances. If a character is
able to reliably alter reality, then "unbounded thought powers" or
"speculative ability related to reality at large" is applicable instead.

:: Examples
In tz1959e1x27 "The Big Tall Wish", Henry warned Bolie that the only way 
Henry's wish that Bolie had won the boxing match would stay granted,
was if Bolie well and truly believed in it. Bolie could not find it in 
himself to believe in such a wacky thing. Therefore reality reverted, and 
Bolie found himself again having lost the boxing match.

immortality
===========

:: Description
A character is able to go on living even when other characters would 
have died. They typically do not age (beyond a point) or if they do, 
death is not inevitably at the end of that process.

:: Notes
The theme "immortality" is considered topical simply if the idea that a 
character may go on living indefinitely is there. Stories are 
surprisingly full of nominally immortal characters that nevertheless
perish, one way or another.

:: Parents

seem to defy explanation or categorization in any meaningful way.

:: Notes
This them does notably not apply in the case of events for which the
character can perceive reasonable sounding possible explanations.
It is meant to capture things that just don't any make sense.
However, if mysterious events are cause by spirits or the like, the 
theme "human vs. the occult" is normally used instead. 

:: Examples
In tz1959e1x34 "The After Hours", Marsha grew increasingly puzzled after she
purchased a gold thimble on the 9th floor of a department that had only eight
floors.


what if I were socially isolated for an extended period of time
===============================================================
