============================================================
== Paulâ€™s Theme Revisionism Notes ==========================
============================================================

- Change "coping with a loved one being in peril" to "coping with someone you care about being in peril".
- Review Jadzia episodes for "what if I had memories of past lives".
- Review usage of "The Hippocratic Oath" to ensure it means "First do no harm". We introduced the new theme "medical assistance to the enemy" to cover that case.
- Generalize "asteroid impact" to "catastrophic impact event" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event).
- rename "attack from outer space by a powerful conquering alien race" to "alien invasion" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_invasion) and merge with related themes, like "attack from outer space by a genocidal enemy".
- check applicability of "helping a stranger in need" in tos/tng episodes
- merge "the desire for glory" and "the desire for glory in battle"?
- merge "facing an invading force" and "facing an overpowering adversary"?
- "coping with having injured a friend" -> "coping with having injured someone (you care about)"
- organize dangling themes under "domestic social issue"
- "divorce" and "unknown parent" are children of "family affairs" 
- Change "reminiscence over one's childhood" to "reminiscence over one's youth"
- Review that we used "rapid aging" only when the technology is used.
- Consider changing "courtesy" to "the nature of courtesy"
- Consider merging all the "coping with the death of X" with "coping with the death of a loved one"
- Check cryogenics episodes for "what if I was brought back to life long after my death"
- Consider adding "what it is like to be a hostage" in episodes featuring hostage situations shown from the hostage point of view.
- Review "adolescence" since we've lost track of using this theme.
- Generalize "hopeless search vs. abandon hope" to something like "feeling compelled to pursue a hopeless action"; consider adding as a minor theme about Sisko's decision to leave Odo and Kira for dead with the Dominion in ds93x01
- Consider generalizing "trust in a friend" to something like "trust in another person"
- Consider adding "the desire for honor" as a "human aspiration".
- PS notices we are using "man vs. machine" and "man vs. technology" inconsistently. A targeted list?
- A targeted list for zombie themes. May merge with "what if people around me started acting all weird".
- Consider merging "diplomatic negotiation" and "diplomatic compromising".
- review usage of "tyranny vs. freedom"
- add "what it is like in a forced labor camp" when appropriate to "forced labor camp" episodes
- consider adding "keeping secrets" as a minor theme to the following Garak episodes
	* ds91x03 Past Prologue: Garak plays coy with Bashir over whether he is a Cardassian spy
	* ds92x05 Cardassians: PS thinks keeping secrets was probably not featured in the episode
	* ds92x18 Profit and Loss: PS thinks keeping secrets was probably not featured in the episode
