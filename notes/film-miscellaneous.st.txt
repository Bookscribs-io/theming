:: Genre
drama

:: Description
The Merchant of Venice is a 2004 romantic drama film based on Shakespeare's
play of the same name. It is the first full-length sound film in English of
Shakespeare's play—other versions are videotaped productions which were made
for television, including John Sichel's 1973 version and Jack Gold's 1980 BBC
production.

The title character is the merchant Antonio (Jeremy Irons), not the Jewish
moneylender Shylock (Al Pacino) who is the more prominent character. This
adaptation follows the text, but omits much. Director Michael Radford believed
that Shylock was Shakespeare's first great tragic hero who reaches a
catastrophe due to his own flaws.[2][3] The film begins with text and a
montage of how the Jewish community is abused by the Christian population of
Venice and brings attention to the fact that, as a convert, Shylock would have
been cast out of the Jewish ghetto in Venice.
