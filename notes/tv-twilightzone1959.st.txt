Time Enough at Last

:: Date
1959-11-20

:: Description
"Time Enough at Last" is the eighth episode of the American television
anthology series The Twilight Zone. The episode was adapted from a short story
written by Lynn Venable. The short story appeared in the January 1953 edition
of the science fiction magazine If: Worlds of Science Fiction about seven
years before the television episode first aired. "Time Enough at Last" became
one of the most famous episodes of the original Twilight Zone and has been
frequently parodied since. It is "the story of a man who seeks salvation in
the rubble of a ruined world" and tells of Henry Bemis, played by Burgess
Meredith, who loves books, yet is surrounded by those who would prevent him
from reading them. The episode follows Bemis through the post-apocalyptic
world, touching on such social issues as anti-intellectualism, the dangers of
reliance upon technology, and the difference between aloneness (solitude) and
loneliness.
