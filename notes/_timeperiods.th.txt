human life in history
=====================

:: Description
We see a reasonable idea of what ordinary human life might have been like for some 
category of people somewhere in the world in the past.

:: Notes
If there is conflict between the nature of civilization in a
story and the time/location the story itself professes to take place, the nature of 
civilization in the story should be used to determine which history theme is
relevant. The precise dating of these time periods is therefore of lesser
importance to the categorization of stories.

If the story is still ambiguous, do not expend energy debating the point
but include all seemingly applicable themes.

It is suggested to use these themes as Major only when the story clearly depicts
something that can be considered a reasonable image of normal life for some
relatively normal category of people. If the focus of the story is, for example,
a heroic figure doing something heroic then the social setting in which it takes 
place may likely be a Minor theme, if a theme at all.
