:: Description
Star Trek: The Animated Series (originally known simply as Star Trek but also known as The Animated Adventures of Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek) is a 1973 animated science fiction television series set in the Star Trek universe following the events of Star Trek: The Original Series of the 1960s. The animated series was aired under the name Star Trek, but it has become widely known under this longer name (or abbreviated as ST: TAS or TAS) to differentiate it from the original live action series. The success of the original live action series in syndication, and fan pressure for a Star Trek revival, led to The Animated Series from 1973–1974, as the source of new adventures of the Enterprise crew, the next being the live-action feature film Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979).

More Tribbles, More Troubles

:: Date
1973-10-06

:: Description
While the USS Enterprise escorts two robot cargo ships carrying quintotriticale, a new seed grain, to famine stricken Sherman's Planet, it encounters a Klingon battlecruiser pursuing a Federation scout ship. When the Enterprise rescues the pilot, the Klingons attack with a new energy weapon and demand that the pilot be handed over to them. The pilot turns out to be Cyrano Jones, an intergalactic trader well known to Kirk and crew from " The Trouble With Tribbles ". The Klingons desperately want Jones for introducing the tribble to Klingon planets where it has become a major pest, and for stealing a glommer, an animal the Klingons were breeding to prey on the tribble. Kirk expresses sympathy for the Klingons' plight but refuses to hand over Jones, a Federation citizen. Jones is now selling tribbles genetically engineered to omit their ordinarily unrestrained multiplicative proclivities. Dr. McCoy discovers that although Jones' "new" tribbles don't reproduce, they still have ravenous appetites. Instead of reproducing, they now grow hugely fat. Kirk and Spock manage to counter the Klingon weapon. Now at a disadvantage, the Klingons offer to settle for just the glommer. Kirk agrees and returns it—along with several well-fed (and huge) tribbles that scare it away. McCoy injects the remaining tribbles on the Enterprise with a serum to slow down their metabolic rate. They are finally "safe".
