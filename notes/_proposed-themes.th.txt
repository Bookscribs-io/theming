Luke Skywalker astrally projected himself across the galaxy to have a showdown
with Kylo Ren in "Star Wars: The Last Jedi" (2017). Note: He also made his

dream walking

If there is nothing special about the dreams themselves, and a character 
merely interacts telepathically with a dreaming person, then "telepathic
ability" is the more appropriate theme.

deleterious effects, on another person, more or less by using their

This would not apply if things are merely teleported to unseen 
locations. Nor does it apply in cases when reality itself is changed
so as to make it as if an object or person had never been.

:: Parents

unbounded thought powers
========================

:: Description
A character is able to do or change reality in practically any
way, qualitatively limited only by imagination.

:: Notes
This theme is used when the ability appears qualitatively unbounded. 
I.e., a character may be seen to do a few limited things, but it is
clear that there are very few limits on what sort of things they can 
do. Typically, this theme is used when a character becomes 
god-like and can will reality to change in the blink of an eye.

:: Parents
speculative ability related to reality at large

:: Examples
Riker was riding on his high horse upon having been granted godlike Q 
powers in tng1x10 "Hide and Q".

magic powers
============

:: Description
A character is able to do at will some fantastical things that involves
speculative supernatural forces that can be described as "magic".

:: Notes
This theme applies when a character uses spells, incantation, and
other classically magic invocations. Unlike, for example, telekinesis
it is clear that the world is manipulated first through the manipulation
of some "magical" force or principle. In essence, the character is not 
directly manipulating real things (as we know them) but manipulates magic.
Thus this becomes a category apart from other "speculative ability" 
themes.
