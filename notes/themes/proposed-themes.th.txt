the astronaut profession

This theme is used with regard to astronautics that are relatively
realistic in accordance with current technology. In science fiction,
speculative technology often makes space flight very different from
what we know today. This theme is notably not used if there is cryogenics,
artificial gravity, or near light-speed travel.

conformist dystopia
===================

:: Description
There is a bleak society in which there is very little diversity because,
one way or the other, people are prevented from developing their
own distinctiveness. There may, for example, be an oppressive government 
that persecutes deviants, or there may be some other social institution
that makes people conform. It may be that people must conform in 
appearance, way of acting, way of thinking, or all three.

:: Parents
dystopia

:: Examples
In tz1959e5x17 "Number 12 Looks Just Like You", we saw a society wherein
everyone upon reaching adulthood were required to undergo a surgical alteration
to transform them into one of a limited preset of physically perfect models.
The procedure clearly affects the mind as well, and is likely maintained
by a remote government in order to maintain conformity and order.


music
=====

:: Description
Music is notably featured in the story. Typically, this is because there 
is a musician, other music professional, or someone else who is very interested 
in music.

:: Notes
As music is rather common in modern society, it is often present in unremarkable
ways in the background of stories. It is generally not considered a theme
just because a normal person briefly listens to music, or a radio is heard
in the background. Nor is music automatically a theme when the story is told
through song, such as in opera.
