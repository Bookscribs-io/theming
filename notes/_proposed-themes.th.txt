superstitiousness
=================

:: Description
There is a character who is abnormally ready to think and act according to
practice based upon trust in luck or other irrational, unscientific, or 
supernatural forces.

:: Notes
This theme is primarily used with respect to common and classical superstitions,
such as fortune telling. It is not used, for example, with respect to beliefs 
that were considered scientific, or even pseudo-scientific, in the context of 
the story.

:: Examples
In tz1959e2x07 "Nick of Time", we saw that William Shatner (as Don) 
was quick to fall victim to the soothsayings of an infernal fortune telling 
machine, and learned that he had both a four-leaf clover and a rabit's foot,
quite sincerely for good luck.

pleasure in the misfortune of another
=====================================

:: Description
A character feels pleasure, joy, or self-satisfaction from learning of or 
witnessing the troubles, failures, or humiliation of another character.

:: Notes
To apply, it should be clear that the feeling is inspired solely by the other's 
misfortune, and is not the result of some secondary advantage gained by the
first character. For example, if an enemy or competitor suffers misfortune 
it may be quite natural to feel joy because of the personal advantage this
entails. Schadenfreude, then, does not apply.

:: Examples
tz1959e2x12 "Dust", the rather odious conman Sykes was gleeful at the prospect 
of Gallegos getting hanged, and tormented him relentlessly.

:: Parents

what if I could only speak the truth
====================================

:: Description
There is a character who is physically unable to tell intentional lies.

:: Notes
This is one of the more-or-less incoherent counterfactuals that appears in
stories: A circumstance arises in which a character tries to speak a lie
(maybe a white lie or omission of the truth), but their mouth ends up
uttering the truth (maybe the whole truth) to the mind's general dismay.
The theme notably does not apply if a character merely chooses not to tell 
lies, be it for moral compulsion on legal injunctions.

:: Examples
In tz1959e2x14 "The Whole Truth", the crooked, used car dealer Mr. Hunnicut 
came into the possession of a haunted car that somehow made him tell the truth, 
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. This proved disastrous for his
business.

to fend off diminutive space invaders who landed in her attic and refused to leave
her be. She eventually destroys their flying saucer ship using a crude hatchet.
