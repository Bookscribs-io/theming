individual human experience
===========================

:: Description
This is the category of themes that center around an individual's personal thoughts, emotions, 
urges, ambitions, and other such experiences. 

:: Notes
We distinguish between "individual human experience", "humans in pairs", and "humans in groups" with 
reference to whose experiences are relevant to the thematic idea that is being expressed. For example
"coping with problematic people" clearly implies the presence of two or more people but the theme
is only concerned with the experiences of a single observer at a time. "romantic relationship",
on the other hand, is a category of themes that most often examine the interaction between two 
people and discuss both their experiences simultanously. Likewise "humans in group" imply themes that
examine the constitution of a whole group of people, for example the idea that "lack of trust can lead 
to group dysfunction."

story and if it is sufficiently relevant to the plot. It may be noted that while there are many
stories in which parental, sibling, half-sibling, step-parent, sibling-in-law, or even
adoptive relationships are important, there are few stories in which consanguinity relations
beyond first cousinage is relevant to the plot.

including the right to participate in science and culture, the right to work, and the right to

This is the category of social issue themes that examine the effects human activity may have at

theme of our times. The issue is that human activity since the industrial revolution has produced 
evermore greenhouse gases; this leads to an unrelenting heating of the whole of the Earth, which in 
turn has varied but significant effects on the climate. As these changes are expected to be widely
detrimental to human well being, many believe that the response from policy makers has been 
lackluster and negligent in the extreme.
