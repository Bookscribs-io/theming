Foster attempts to delay her again. Sat in the car and just about to leave,
he says he has forgotten a gift for their daughter and says he will go back
into the house to get it. Mrs. Foster then notices the gift stuck in the car.
Frantic to get to the airport on time, she runs after him to tell him she's
found the gift, and sees that he has taken their in-house elevator to go
upstairs. She hears him shouting her name and realises her husband is stuck
in the lift. A slight smile twitches across her face. She returns to the car
and tells the driver to take her to the airport. She gets her revenge on his

lift has been stuck between two floors all that time, during which her husband
has died of starvation and thirst. She calmly calls the Elevator Emergency
