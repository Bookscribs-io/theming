:: Choice Themes
faith vs. reason [Dr. Vergerus and Concul Egerman discussed whether there could be anything that is beyond science, and came to wager on Albert's abilities being genuine or not. The rest of the story tied into this wager and its object.],

:: Major Themes
con artistry [Tubal and Albert's activities ranged from pseudo medicine to outright quackery],

husband and wife [especially Albert and Manda],

:: Minor Themes
facing death [drunken man, Johan Spegel, in the forest explained his experiences as he died - or so we thought],
the nature of death [Spegel spoke of death],
coping with the death of a child [Ottilia spoke of her late daughter and her grief],
love potion [Tubal sold love potions to eager enough maid servants],
quackery [Tubal and granny Vogler peddled all sorts of fake remedies],
what is truth [this metaphysical question was touched on by Spegel when he confronted Tubal in the carriage in the beginning],
hatred [Dr. Vergerus spoke to Albert about hatred, Albert expressed hatred to his marks],
female sexuality [],
extramarital affair [Mrs. Starbeck implied that some of her children were not MR. Starbeck's],
suicide [Spegel spoke of laying bare his own entrails (etc); Antonsson killed himself],
lesson in humility [the film concluded with a lengthy lesson being administered to Vergerus, who denied that it had been effective],

Wild Strawberries

:: Description
Wild Strawberries is a 1957 Swedish drama film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. The original Swedish title is Smultronstället, which literally means "the wild strawberry patch" but idiomatically signifies an underrated gem of a place, often with personal or sentimental value. The cast includes Victor Sjöström in his final screen performance as an old man recalling his past, as well as Bergman regulars Bibi Andersson, Ingrid Thulin, and Gunnar Björnstrand. Max von Sydow also appears in a small role.
