Because of their notoriety, we consider that a "crime in society" theme is
topical to the story when a character unambiguously commits such a crime. For
example "murder in society" becomes topical if a murder is committed. Common
sense is required here: For example, Action movies frequently feature actions
that would arguably be "crimes" yet are not treated as such in the story for
one reason or another (action heroes often appear to be above the law). It is
not the purpose of this category to catalog such things.
