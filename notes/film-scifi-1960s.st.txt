:: Description
United States Navy Commander Jim Bradley is sent to Japan to test a new chemical that will desalinate water. However, the indigenous population are against the experiments in their salt lake. They fear that the chemical will re-awaken their ancient god, Obaki, who they say lives in the lake. Despite their objections, the villagers are evacuated and the experiment goes on as scheduled. As they feared, the chemical reawakens their god, a giant prehistoric monster. The creature destroys the local village and then heads to the city of Oneida.
