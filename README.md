# Theming

http://www.themeontology.org/  


### /notes

Collaborate on files or create a directory with your name and work on files in private here.
Any published stories (books, movies, tv shows, ...) are welcome.
Use themes that are already defined in the first hand.
Use the search tools on the main page.
Invent new themes when needed.

### /canon

Any data on which there is broad consensus from the main contributors may be uploaded here.
The idea is to keep this more or less in sync with the data on http://www.themeontology.org.

### /auto

Data committed into /notes will be automatically parsed and collated into tables here.
Files ending in "-stories.txt" will be parsed.
These tables may be copied, edited and uploaded to the main site.
Do not commit manually into the /auto directory.


## What is a Theme?

A theme is any topic that is featured in a story.
A central theme is a topic that is topical throughout most of the story, either because it is featured explicitly or because it is revealed as the "moral of the story" towards the end.
A peripheral theme is any theme of interest that is featured briefly.
In the notes, peripheral themes are called "minor". 
Central themes are called "major" or "choice".
Choice themes are whatever seems to be at the essence of the story.

There are no strict rules for what makes a good theme to include.
There are a few rules of thumb.
Look mostly for major/choice themes.
Prefer to use themes that are already defined.
Don't waste time including uninteresting minor themes but feel free to include what interests you.
Good themes are topics that are featured sgnificantly in various different stories.
Don't introduce themes that are specific to a particular fictional universe; generalize them instead.
Look for themes that are obvious and seem uncontroversial.
Look for themes that expose our human nature through the stories we make.

"The desire for vengeance", "the horrors of war", "faith vs. reason", "what if I had magical powers", are examples of good themes that we find in many different stories.


## Why?

Data from this repository can easily be incorporated into http://www.themeontology.org/. 
There it can be analyzed in various ways.
This tells us interesting things about the kind of stories we humans invent.
Theming is also a good personal way to reflect on what really goes on in the stories we enjoy.
