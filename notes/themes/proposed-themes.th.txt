human emotion

:: Notes
To apply, it should be clear that the feeling is inspired solely by the
other's misfortune, and is not the result of some secondary advantage gained
by the first character. For example, if an enemy or competitor suffers
misfortune it may be quite natural to feel joy because of the personal
advantage this entails. Schadenfreude, then, does not apply.

altering problematic habits for a willing subject. Typically, multiple
