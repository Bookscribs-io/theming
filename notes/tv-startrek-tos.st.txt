forcing the Enterprise to abandon the duo on the planet. The natives protect
Kirk and Spock, even as Kor , the new Klingon governor, orders mass executions
of the Organian people. As both Federation and Klingon fleets converge above
the planet, Kirk and Spock execute a daring raid on the Klingon headquarters
