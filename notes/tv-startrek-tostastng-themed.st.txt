:: Title
Beyond the Farthest Star

:: Description
While exploring on the outermost rim of the galaxy the USS Enterprise is
pulled into the orbit of a dead star. Trapped there, the crew discovers that
there is an ancient derelict pod ship trapped with them as well. Kirk and crew
beam aboard the huge starship and learn it was once home to an insect race.
They also learn that the ship's crew self-destructed rather than carry a
malevolent entity to other worlds. The entity is still alive and it beams
aboard the Enterprise. Captain Kirk must find a way to get rid of the invader,
without destroying his ship in the process.

:: Description
Investigating a sector of space where starships have disappeared every 27
years, the Enterprise finds a race of beautiful women living on the planet
Taurus II. While in the Taurean system signals begin to affect the male crew,
causing them to hallucinate. Captain Kirk, Spock, Doctor McCoy , and
Lieutenant Carver beam down to the source of the signals. After arriving on
the planet they are taken prisoner by the Taurean women. The landing party
begins to age rapidly as a result of life-draining headbands they are forced
to wear. On board the Enterprise, Uhura has taken command due to Scotty's
irrational behavior. Uhura orders an all-female landing party to transport
down to rescue the men.

More Tribbles, More Troubles

:: Description
While the USS Enterprise escorts two robot cargo ships carrying
quintotriticale, a new seed grain, to famine stricken Sherman's Planet, it
encounters a Klingon battlecruiser pursuing a Federation scout ship. When the
Enterprise rescues the pilot, the Klingons attack with a new energy weapon and
demand that the pilot be handed over to them. The pilot turns out to be Cyrano
Jones, an intergalactic trader well known to Kirk and crew from " The Trouble
With Tribbles ". The Klingons desperately want Jones for introducing the
tribble to Klingon planets where it has become a major pest, and for stealing
a glommer, an animal the Klingons were breeding to prey on the tribble. Kirk
expresses sympathy for the Klingons' plight but refuses to hand over Jones, a
Federation citizen. Jones is now selling tribbles genetically engineered to
omit their ordinarily unrestrained multiplicative proclivities. Dr. McCoy
discovers that although Jones' "new" tribbles don't reproduce, they still have
ravenous appetites. Instead of reproducing, they now grow hugely fat. Kirk and
Spock manage to counter the Klingon weapon. Now at a disadvantage, the
Klingons offer to settle for just the glommer. Kirk agrees and returns
it—along with several well-fed (and huge) tribbles that scare it away. McCoy
injects the remaining tribbles on the Enterprise with a serum to slow down
their metabolic rate. They are finally "safe".

crew discovers that most of the Phylosians were wiped out by a plague brought
to the planet by Dr. Keniclius, a Terran scientist who survived Earth's
Eugenics Wars . A giant clone of Keniclius, named Keniclius Five, kidnaps Mr.
Spock in order to clone him and create an intergalactic peacemaker, at the
expense of the original Spock's life. (Although Kirk never actually says "Beam

The Enterprise crew revisits the "amusement park" planet first seen in the

crew discover the planet's Keeper is now dead and the untended machinery is
constructing dangerous images from the crew members' thoughts. Lt. Uhura is
captured by the planet's master computer, who in the wake of the Keeper's
death, resents being made to serve humans. After a number of unpleasant
adventures and narrow escapes, Kirk succeeds in interviewing the angry
computer. He convinces it that its best course is to resume business as usual,
as it will be rewarded with social contact by the many guests attracted by the
planet's facilities and can, in time, learn everything it could possibly want
to without even being put to the inconvenience of leaving its home planet.

DNA fallacy

:: Notes
(1) This is the perfect example of a bad episode. A futuristic setting is completely unnecessary to tell this story. Racism. (2)Their medical theory is obsessed with DNA. I guess they have some notion that all disease can be explained in terms of modifications to DNA. (3)Maltuvis device: Mexican rebellion, Irish rebellion of 2024, lol (4) *We require a term to describe when someone holds a preconception about some group (or person) and later gains a deeper understanding of them.

1) The displays in engineering are fixed to show vessel schematics. A mere 20 years later, it's all to obvious to us that displays should be able to show anything the viewer want called up. 2) The security authorization code 13:00 was exceedingly long. 3) Why don't they use an old actor to play an old man, rather than making up a middle aged man. 4) need a term for people seeking continuity after death.

1) A hilarious misunderstanding of dark matter is illustrated by Riker when he says "Let's light up this nebula." 2) Data misses an opportunity to use the Maltuvis device in the teaser when he talks about the romantic failings of King Henry VIII. 3) The realization just dawned on me that the model for Data is an autistic person. 1) Humans have "programs" running in their brains, too. 2) Why is she perpetually acting like Data should have emotions when she knows very well he does not? Does star fleet's “highest standards of quality” allow for complete morons on the flagship?

Despite exposure to fatal radiation , the Federation colony on Omicron Ceti

that seem to impose a state of pure bliss on all exposed to its spores (even
Spock), but at the cost of ambition and self-discipline. Will the Enterprise
