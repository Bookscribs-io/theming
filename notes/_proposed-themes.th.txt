A character expresses the sentiment that they are better than others

:: Notes
The theme is not used about specific and limited attributes a character may feel,

they are better at the game of pool than others, this may rather be called 
"pride in an ability", or perhaps "hubris".

the afterlife
=============

:: Description
The idea that we somehow continue to exist in spirit after we die is
discussed. The story contains some information about what might be in store
for us, spiritually, post-mortem.

:: Parents
organized religion

:: Notes
- We consider this theme to be topical, for example, if it is featured
that a living person dies and transitions to being a ghost as the idea that this
can happen when we die, is then implicit. 

- We do not otherwise apply this theme in a story where there just appears to 
be an incorporeal spirit, unless it is made explicitly clear that
this is the after-life existence that can occasionally happen to people.

- In some stories there is a character that is the Grim Reaper, or similar.
Surprisingly often, nothing further is said about whence (if anywhere) he is to 
escort the deceased. Thus "the afterlife" does not appear to apply.

- In some stories, the deceased character appears to remain in the world briefly
for the purpose of relaying the story more than to suggest that this is a
possible continuation of their spiritual existence. Unless matters are clarified
further, we do not apply "the afterlife" as a theme.

:: Examples
Ro and Geordi thought they might have died and become wandering spirits in
tng5x24 "The Next Phase", before finding out that they had merely been phase
shifted.

supernatural ability
====================

:: Description
A character has an intrinsic ability that is arguably beyond what real 
humans ever can have today, and this ability is also extraordinary in the world
that the character inhabits.

:: Notes
There is a gray area around tool usage. Generally, if a character uses an
object that anyone could use then the tool in question is what is extraordinary,
and not the character's ability to use it. However, if the tool is uniquely
connected to a user then arguably this user has an extraordinary ability.
Due judgment must be exercised, and this category may be refined as we go forwards.

This theme applies if there is a conflict situation in which at least one side
won't back off because of some cultural idiosyncrasy which is notably different 
from that of the other side. 

The theme notably does not apply if the reasons both sides perpetuate the conflict 
because of such relatively universal values as: self-preservation, greed, etc.

:: Examples
In tng1x04 "Code of Honor", The Ligonian leader Lutan thought it quite reasonable to 
kidnap Tasha, a lowly woman as he saw it, for his intrigues and was then honor-bound 
to stand his ground. The Federation people, on the other hand, saw things differently

became inevitable.
