A character is able to go on living even when other characters would 
have died. They typically do not age (beyond a point) or if they do, 
death is not inevitably at the end of that process.

The theme "immortality" is considered topical simply if the idea that a 
character may go on living indefinitely is there. Stories are 
surprisingly full of nominally immortal characters that nevertheless
perish, one way or another.

It is meant to capture things that just don't any make sense.
However, if mysterious events are cause by spirits or the like, the 
theme "human vs. the occult" is normally used instead.

purchased a gold thimble on the 9th floor of a department that had only eight
floors.
