play: Ghosts (1882)
===================

:: Title
Ghosts

:: Author
Henrik Ibsen

:: Description
It was written in 1881 and first staged in 1882 in Chicago, Illinois, in a production by a 
Danish company on tour. Like many of Ibsen's plays, Ghosts is a scathing commentary on 
19th-century morality. Because of its subject matter, which includes religion, venereal disease, 
incest, and euthanasia, it immediately generated strong controversy and negative criticism. 
Since then the play has fared better, and is considered a "reat play" that historically holds 
a position of "immense importance". Theater critic Maurice Valency wrote in 1963, "From the 
standpoint of modern tragedy Ghosts strikes off in a new direction.... Regular tragedy dealt mainly 
with the unhappy consequences of breaking the moral code. Ghosts, on the contrary, deals with the 
consequences of not breaking it."

father and daughter [Hjalmar and Hedvig],
familial love [Hedvig loved her father deeply and he doted on her until he discovered she might have been illegitimate],
having a skeleton in the closet [the Ekdal home is full of lies that people tell in order to get along.
