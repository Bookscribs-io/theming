Star Trek: Discovery is an American television series created for CBS All Access by Bryan Fuller and Alex Kurtzman. It is the first series developed specifically for that service, and the first Star Trek series since Star Trek: Enterprise concluded in 2005. Set roughly a decade before the events of the original Star Trek series and separate from the timeline of the concurrently produced feature films, Discovery explores the Federationâ€“Klingon war while following the crew of the USS Discovery. Gretchen J. Berg and Aaron Harberts served as showrunners for the first season, with producing support from Akiva Goldsman; Kurtzman began serving as showrunner during the second season.
