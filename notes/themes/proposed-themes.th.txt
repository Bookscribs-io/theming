hearing voices
==============

:: Description
A character hears, and perhaps talks back to, a voice of a separate entity
which the character incorrectly thinks is real. In clinical terms the
condition might be classified as auditory hallucinations, or schizophrenia.

:: Notes
The theme does not apply when a character merely has an internal dialog with
their own id. Nor does it apply in fantastical situations where the origin of
the voice is understood to be through telepathy, produced by spirits, or the
like. There's a variety of stories where the question of whether the voice is
real or not (and thus the sanity of the character) itself is a central topic:
in this case the theme applies inasmuch the idea implied in the definition is
entertained as a possibility.

ego in his head which offered to fulfill his any wish. In the end we are left
wondering whether the voice was a real entity, or Grady had gone mad.
