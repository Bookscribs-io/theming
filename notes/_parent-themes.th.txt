individual human experience
===========================

:: Description
This is the category of themes that center around an individual's personal thoughts, emotions, 
urges, ambitions, and other such experiences. 

:: Note
We distinguish between "individual human experience", "humans in pairs", and "humans in groups" with 
reference to whose experiences are relevant to the thematic idea that is being expressed. For example
"coping with problematic people" clearly implies the presence of two or more people but the theme
is only concerned with the experiences of a single observer at a time. "romantic relationship",
on the other hand, is a category of themes that most often examine the interaction between two 
people and discuss both their experiences simultanously. Likewise "humans in group" imply themes that
examine the constitution of a whole group of people, for example the idea that "lack of trust can lead 
to group dysfunction."

humans in group
===============

:: Description
This is the category of themes that examine human group dynamics, or some experience simultanously applicable to each member of a group of people.

:: Note
We distinguish between "individual human experience", "humans in pairs", and "humans in groups" with 
reference to whose experiences are relevant to the thematic idea that is being expressed. For example
"coping with problematic people" clearly implies the presence of two or more people but the theme

about us that jeopardize our social standing which might (historically) lead to ostracization,
