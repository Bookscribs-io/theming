:: Examples
In tng3x23 "Sarek", the eponymous Vulcan refuses to acknowledge the obvious

studying for a test
===================

:: Description

Formal tests are typically associated with schooling, and thus the early

an adult character is "studying for a test" in a story, the reviewer must
decide whether the situation resembles school tests enough that the idea of
"human childhood" is implied.

poetic justice
==============

:: Description
An evildoer ironically falls victim to the very wickedness that they themself
intended for someone else.

This theme does not apply if the result is achieved through the considered
designs of another character, for example as vengeance. It must also be
reasonably clear that the irony is a noteworthy component of the story.

if a murderer ends up getting murdered, it is only "poetic justice" if there
is a salient similarity in methodology between the intended and the actual
murder.

:: Parents

:: Examples
In nightgallery2x19a "Deliveries in the Rear", Dr. Fletcher is perfectly
content to look the other way while innocent people are murdered in order to
provide cadavers for dissection in his anatomy class. Eventually, in an ironic
