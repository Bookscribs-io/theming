The City on the Edge of Forever

:: Description
After accidentally overdosing on a powerful stimulant, Dr. McCoy becomes
unbalanced and disappears through the Guardian of Forever , a newly discovered
time portal on a remote planet. Kirk and Spock follow after learning that
McCoy somehow changed history. Arriving in the 1930s, the duo meet Edith
Keeler, a New York social worker who gives them a place to stay. As the days

Keeler... but Spock discovers that Keeler must die to restore the timeline.
