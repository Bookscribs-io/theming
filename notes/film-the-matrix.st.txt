:: Major Themes
simulated reality [Humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated reality called the Matrix.],
virtual person [Mr. Smith and others inside the Matrix existed as sentient computer program. Neo and the other resistors had the ability to make virtual instances of themselves inside the Matrix.],
what if the fate of the world was in my hands [Morpheus was convinced that Neo was "the one" who was prophesied to destroy the Matrix.],
resistance movement [Morpheus recruited Neo into his group of freedom fighters who were trying to destroy the Matrix.],
the power of thought [There was an ongoing theme bound up with something about Neo being able to control the laws of physics inside the Matrix environment so long as he believed in himself.],
computer hacking [Neo was a computer hacker character. Neo commented on how Trinity had hacked the IRS database. More pervasively, Morpheus and the resistors were constantly hacking into the Matrix.],
rise of the machines [The film was set in a world in which intelligent machines had won a war against humans and were using them as human batteries to power their world.],
human vs. machine [Morpheus and his resistance fighter were in a desperate struggle to put an end to intelligent machines using humans as batteries to power their civilization.],
the fulfillment of prophesy [Morpheus was convinced that Neo was "the one" who was prophesied to destroy the Matrix.],
ignorance is bliss [Mr. Smith gave Neo the choice to return to live a happy live inside the Matrix, having no memory of the harsh reality that it was just a fantasy world, but Neo chose to face reality and join Morpheus in his quest to overthrow the tyranny of the machines. Cypher spoke this aphorism in a conversation with Mr. Smith in which Cypher expressed the desire to return from the real world into the Matrix.],

romantic love [Neo and Trinity.],
déjà vu [The experience of this phenomenon was attributed to a glitch in the Matrix.],

facing organized pursuit [Morpheus helped Neo elude capture by some men in black led by Mr. Smith, although his effort ultimately proved to be unsuccessful.],
the thirst for knowledge [The film started off with Neo seeking to know what the Internet rumors about "the Matrix" were all about.],
plug-in learning device [Neo learned jiu jitsu and kung fu by having the techniques uploaded into his brain.],
human battery [The intelligent machines kept unconscious humans in pods and used them to somehow generate electricity to power their civilization.],
fusion power [The intelligent machines used a combination of fusion power and human batteries to power their civilization.],
opposition to authority [Neo's boss at the software company inside the Matrix complained that Neo thought the rules somehow didn't apply to him.],
