Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, Lena Waithe, T.J. Miller, Simon Pegg, and Mark
Rylance. The film takes place in 2045, when much of humanity uses the virtual
reality software OASIS to escape the desolation of the real world. Orphaned
teenager Wade Watts (Sheridan) discovers clues to a hidden game within the
program that promises the winner full ownership of the OASIS, and joins
several allies to try to complete the game before a large company run by
businessman Nolan Sorrento (Mendelsohn) can do so.

:: Genre
sci-fi

:: Choice Themes
cooperation [to succeed people had to work together; being unclanned was in the end not good; the game creator regretted buying out his companion.],

virtual reality suit [people were using them to escape reality],
escape from reality [people escaped their crappy reality by going to the OASIS],
pleasure in playing games [the joy we take in playing games was commented on],
the reasons for playing games [this was probably also what it was about],
overpopulated dystopia [it is a little unclear what the abysmal conditions in the future were due to but since we saw enormous slums this seems like a good guess],
atrophied civilization [civilization stagnated because people preferred to spend time in the game; thus at the end two game-free days per week were mandated],
video game addiction in society [gaming wasn't bad but it could clearly be taken to excess, hence two game-free days per week at the end],
romantic love [Wade and Samantha],
