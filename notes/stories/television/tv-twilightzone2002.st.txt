youth rebellion [The story follows the Winslow's as they move to a gated community with stringent rules in a last ditched attempt to get the rebellious teen of the family Jenna on the right path in life.] <For discussion: Perhaps this can be renamed to "rebellious youth" and moved under "human childhood". Note to PS: replace "flappers in society" by whatever this theme becomes. MO: the clockwork orange kind can be a social issue, but not this story I think. Consider adding a criminal youth gang theme>,
