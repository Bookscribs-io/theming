:: Genre
sci-fi

:: Choice Themes
android clone of a person [George set about making an android clone of his supposedly deceased wife Jules.],
coping with the death of a spouse [George so loved his supposedly deceased wife Jules that he set about creating an android body in which to embody a digital near-copy of her consciousness.],

:: Major Themes
grief [George was wracked with anguish over the supposed death of his wife in an automobile crash. He had recurrent flashback of them being together in life, and he wanted nothing less than to embody a digital near-copy of her consciousness into a very lifelike android body.],
personal identity [The J3 AI was eerily similar to Georges supposedly deceased wife Jules.],
maker and machine [George created three mechanical people in his compound. The clunky J2 robot had a very human-like personality, while the more advanced J3 android was eerily similar to his supposedly deceased with Jules.],
digital clone of a person [The Archive company was marketing a technology that enabled one to preserve a digital near-copy of their consciousness to life on after their bodily death.],
jealousy [The J2 prototype couldn't bear to see George with the more advanced J3 prototype, and ultimately committed suicide by submerging itself in a lake.],

:: Minor Themes
mechanical man [The clunky J2 prototype.],
coping with memories of a lost love [George had recurrent flashbacks about being with his supposedly deceased wife.],
suicide [The J2 prototype committed suicide by submerging itself in a lake.],
freedom of information vs. patent system [An Archive company representative accused George of having violated one of their patents in his making of a very human-like .],
expecting parents [Flashback scenes revealed that Jules and George were expecting their first child.],
husband and wife [We saw George and Jules living as a happily married couple in various flashback scenes.],
romantic love [We saw George and Jules living as a happily married couple in various flashback scenes.],

:: Not Themes
ironic twist of fate [George worked tirelessly to build an android body to harbor a digital near-copy of the consciousness of his deceased wife, but in the end it turned out that we were being shown a digital near-copy of George's consciousness, and that his wife was still alive. But this theme does not apply because George's digitized consciousness never realized this point.],
